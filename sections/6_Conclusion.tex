\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, we implemented (m,k)-firm RMS, (m,k)-firm EDF, and (m,k)-firm DBP into the Simso simulator. We compared them against basic RMS and EDF algorithms, and analyzed the performance of each algorithms in terms of three main metrics, preemption rate, deadline miss ratio, and fraction of windows that satisfy (m,k) requirements. Finally, we explored each algorithm's trade-offs and argued that in many cases, like in a super-overloaded system, basic RMS and EDF can offer better performance at a significantly lower overhead cost than (m,k)-firm RMS, (m,k)-firm EDF, and (m,k)-firm DBP, which, intuitively, should perform better than RMS and EDF in a system with tasks with (m,k) requirements.

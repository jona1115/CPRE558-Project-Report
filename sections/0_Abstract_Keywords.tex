\begin{abstract}
Simso, an open source scheduling simulator~\cite{cheramy2014simso}, does not natively support scheduling of (m,k)-firm tasks. In this project, we implemented (m,k)-firm RMS, (m,k)-firm EDF, and (m,k)-firm DBP (Distance Based Priority) scheduling in Simso. Using EDF as baseline scheduler, we also compared their performance in terms of preemption rate, deadline miss ratio, and fraction of windows that satisfy (m,k) requirements. We found that having a fancy scheduler doesn't always mean better performance. Even surprisingly, we found that for challenging system load, basic RMS and EDF algorithms can perform significantly better than (m,k)-firm algorithms at a fraction of the overhead cost.
